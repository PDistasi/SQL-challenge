# SQL-challenge
Module 9 Homework GT DV Boot Camp

This challenge was analyzing 6 different databases and performing inner joins to display results.

I used the QuickSQLDB website at https://www.quickdatabasediagrams.com/ and have uploaded a picture of my final ERD:

I then exported the code to SQLAlchemy and imported the .csv data files.

I then performed queries per the instructions and returned the correct results. Here are the results:
